# Logic-Based-Programming (LBP)

## Terms
* parent_node : a node with no input
* child_node  : a node decending from another node
* final_node  : a node with no output

## Setup
node
  - gate
    * gates are nodes with an input and output
  - finalizer
    * finalizers are nodes that have no output
  they simply server as the end result
  eg. print

## layers
nodes
  * creating all of the nodes

logic/traversing
  * all of the logic between the nodes happens
  while traversing them.
    - Alternative
      all logic happens in the nodes which in turn traverse each other.

react
  * visual gates
  * userstate
    - dragging nodes
    - connecting nodes
